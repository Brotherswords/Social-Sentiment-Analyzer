Let’s stop this already! No more fighting! Let’s end this! 
This is a waste of life! Each one of these Marines has a family waiting for them at home! 
We’ve already completed our goal! Chasing after pirates who have no will to fight, desiring for wars that could be prevented, abandoning Marines that could be saved if attended to, and just piling more sacrifices on top of them! 
Every Marine that falls from here on out don’t you think they’ll look like complete idiots?”
